## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

\newpage

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Show map in test

example of a leaflet map in Rmarkdown

```{r leaflet, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles %>% # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  setView(lng = 5.0, lat = 51.0, zoom = 6)
```
